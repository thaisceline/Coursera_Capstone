Manchester is known for its culture, architecture, sports clubs, transport connections and social impact. I recently moved to Manchester and that is why I chose it, I plan to buy a house and settle here in the future, I'll consider points that a person in their 20's who just started their career would be intersted in, such as number of social venues and lower housing prices.\nConsidering these points, I will create a map and information chart including housing prices and each area will be clustered according to venue density.",
